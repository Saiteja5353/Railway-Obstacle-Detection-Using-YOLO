# Railway-Obstacle-Detection-Using-YOLO
Railway Obstacle Detection using YOLOv3 is a deep learning project designed to detect obstacles on railway tracks in real-time. It uses the YOLOv3 object detection algorithm to identify objects like humans, animals, etc. The system is trained on a custom dataset annotated in YOLO format implemented with python, OpenCV
